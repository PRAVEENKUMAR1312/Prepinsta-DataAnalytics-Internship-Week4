Prepinsta Data Analysis Week 4

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of four different datasets using Python, with an emphasis on leveraging the Pandas and Numpy libraries for data manipulation and analysis, and Seaborn and Plotly for data visualization. The project includes extensive data preprocessing to ensure the datasets are clean and suitable for analysis, ultimately aiming to extract meaningful insights and understand patterns within the data.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data quality across four distinct datasets.

Data Manipulation: Utilizing Pandas for transforming and analyzing data, including operations such as grouping, filtering, and aggregating.

Data Visualization: Employing Seaborn and Plotly to create informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations that help in comprehending trends and patterns within the data.

Insights and Conclusions: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis and visualizations, supporting data-driven decisions.

Libraries and Tools Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Numpy: For numerical operations, offering support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, making it easy to generate complex plots with minimal code.

Plotly: For interactive and dynamic data visualizations, allowing for detailed and engaging graphical representations.
